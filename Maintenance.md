# Maintenance:
  To access the inside of any of the **panels**:
    
    1) There square headed screw on the bottom of the table that needs to taken out.
    
    2) The whole panel can be lifted straight up slowly.
    
    3) If possible leave the wires connected. (The wires only come apart at the red connectors, not on the buttons)
   
    4) Maintenance is most likely required for a) tightening the buttons, b) checking wire connections, or c) the simon 
    needs its batteries replaced
     
      a) There is a simple plastic nut on the bottom of the button that can be tightened to stop the buttons from moving

      b) Check to see if there is any lose hanging wire. If there is, the red wire goes into the top prong sticking out the side
      , the black wire goes into side with less plastic, and the colored wire goes out the bottom prong.

      c) Batteries should be taped inside otherwise it is 3 double A batteries.

    5) When done, Lower panel back in and make sure the panel doesn't sit on any wires.

    6) Put the square headed screw back in.

  To access the inside of the **Control Panel**:
    
    1) There square headed screw on the bottom of the table that needs to taken out.

    2) The whole panel can be lifted straight up slowly. (There are a lot of wire connections inside and pulling it to far 
    would make them break)

    3) The control panel should realistically be able to be held or placed on an object 2-4 inches above the table.

    4) This is the mostlikely place for something to have gone wrong due to the number of wires. 

      a)The stuff that is extraneous: The small speakers inside of the control panel and their wires, the transistor 
      and resistors, and one of the 12 volt power supply.

      b) Random Blinking LED (the two side panels)
      : These are connnected to the Arduino Uno (the smaller one) in the front of the control panel 
      (see Wiring of Button Panels and Connectors)


      c) Button Controlled LED (Central Panel)
      : These are individually connected to the Arduino Mega (the bigger one) in the back of the control panel. 
      (See Wiring inside of the Control Panel)
      
    5) When done, Lower panel back in and make sure the panel doesn't sit on any wires.

    6) Put the square headed screw back in.
